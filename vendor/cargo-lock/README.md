Self-contained [serde]-powered `Cargo.lock` parser/serializer with support for
both the V1 and V2 (merge-friendly) formats, as well as optional dependency
tree analysis features. Used by [RustSec].

When the `dependency-tree` feature of this crate is enabled, it supports
computing a directed graph of the dependency tree, modeled using the
[`petgraph`] crate, along with support for printing dependency trees ala
the [`cargo-tree`] crate.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **1.41** or higher.

Minimum supported Rust version can be changed in the future, but it will be
done with a minor version bump.

## SemVer Policy

- MSRV is considered exempt from SemVer as noted above
- The `cargo lock` CLI interface is not considered to have a stable interface
  and is also exempted from SemVer. We reserve the right to make substantial
  changes to it at any time (for now)

## Command Line Interface

This crate provides a `cargo lock` subcommand which can be installed with:

```
$ cargo install cargo-lock --features=cli
```

It supports the following subcommands:

- `list`: list packages in `Cargo.lock`
- `translate`: translate `Cargo.lock` files between the V1 and V2 formats
- `tree`: print a dependency tree from `Cargo.lock` alone

See the [crate documentation][docs-link] for more detailed usage information.
