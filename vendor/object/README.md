# `object`

The `object` crate provides a unified interface to working with object files
across platforms. It supports reading object files and executable files,
and writing object files.

For reading files, it provides multiple levels of support:

* raw struct definitions suitable for zero copy access
* low level APIs for accessing the raw structs
* a higher level unified API for accessing common features of object files, such
  as sections and symbols

Supported file formats: ELF, Mach-O, Windows PE/COFF, Wasm, and Unix archive.
