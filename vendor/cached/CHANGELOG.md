# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
## Added
## Changed
## Removed

## [0.44.0] / [cached_proc_macro[0.17.0]]
## Added
- Option to enable redis multiplex-connection manager on `AsyncRedisCache`
## Changed
- Show proc-macro documentation on docs.rs
- Document needed feature flags
- Hide implementation details in documentation
- Relax `Cached` trait's `cache_get`, `cache_get_mut` and `cache_remove` key parameter. Allow `K: Borrow<Q>`
  like `std::collections::HashMap` and friends. Avoids copies particularly on `Cached<String, _>` where now
  you can do `cache.cache_get("key")` and before you had to `cache.cache_get("key".to_string())`.

  Note: This is a minor breaking change for anyone manually implementing the `Cached` trait.
  The signatures of `cache_get`, `cache_get_mut`, and `cache_remove` must be updated to include the
  additional trait bound on the `key` type:
  ```rust
    fn cache_get<Q>(&mut self, key: &Q) -> Option<&V>
    where
        K: std::borrow::Borrow<Q>,
        Q: std::hash::Hash + Eq + ?Sized,
    {
  ```
## Removed
- Dependency to `lazy_static` and `async_once` are removed.

  cache-priming function.

## Added
- Add `sync_writes` option to `#[cached]` macro to synchronize
  concurrent function calls of duplicate arguments. For ex, if
  a long running `#[cached(sync_writes = true)]` function is called
  several times concurrently, the actual function is only executed
  once while all other calls block and return the newly cached value.

## Added
- Add `#[once]` macro for create a `RwLock` cache wrapping a single value

  contents. This makes it possible to manually dump a cache, so its contents
  can be saved and restored later.
